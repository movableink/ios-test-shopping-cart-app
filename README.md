# MovableInk iOS Sample Apps

This repo contains 2 shoping experience type sample apps (Inkredible Retail), one in SwiftUI and the other UIKit, to show how you might
utilize the MovableInk SDK in your apps.

InAppMessagingSalesforce is an example of how you might use a MovableInk In App Message with Salesforce Marketing Cloud without utilizing the MovableInk SDK.
